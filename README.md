# Queueing System Simulator

This repository contains a queueing system simulator implemented in Dart. The simulator models various queueing systems by tracking events generated by different types of processes and evaluates the system's performance by computing statistics on event wait times. It is designed to simulate and analyze queueing systems in scenarios such as resource management and event-driven applications.

## Overview
The queueing system simulator allows users to model and analyze different types of queueing systems. It provides a framework to simulate events and their impact on system performance, including metrics such as wait times and system utilization. The simulator is highly flexible and can be applied to a range of real-world scenarios, including high-traffic situations and random event arrivals.

## Features
- **Multiple Process Types**: Support for modeling Singleton, Periodic, and Stochastic processes.
- **Event Tracking**: Tracks events and their transitions through the queueing system.
- **Performance Metrics**: Computes and displays key statistics such as average wait time, queue length, and system utilization.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable to include additional process types or queueing models.
- **Configurable via YAML**: Simulation processes and parameters can be defined using a YAML configuration file.

## Queueing Systems
A queueing system manages requests for a resource and processes them as the resource becomes available. The simulator models various types of queueing systems, tracking event arrival and service times to analyze the overall performance of the system. It generates statistics like total events, total wait time, and average wait time to help users understand system behavior.

## Processes

### Singleton Process
A Singleton Process generates a single event at a specified time. This process is useful for testing and simulating one-time events in the system.

### Periodic Process
A Periodic Process generates events at fixed intervals. This process is ideal for scenarios where events occur regularly, such as scheduled arrivals or periodic checks.

### Stochastic Process
A Stochastic Process generates events based on an exponential probability distribution. This process is used to simulate random event arrivals, commonly observed in real-world queueing systems.

## Installation
To run the simulator, ensure that you have Dart installed on your system. Clone this repository and run the following commands:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using the appropriate URL.
2. Change into the project directory.
3. Get the dependencies required for the project using Dart's package manager.

## Usage
To simulate a queueing system, create an instance of the desired process and add it to the simulation environment. The following steps describe a basic setup:

1. Import the necessary Dart file that includes the queueing system simulator.
2. Initialize the simulation environment by creating an instance of `QueueSimulator`.
3. Create and add processes to the simulator, including Singleton, Periodic, and Stochastic processes.
4. Run the simulation by invoking the `run` method.
5. Output performance metrics using the `printStatistics` method.

## Examples
You can find additional examples in the `examples/` directory. These examples demonstrate how to configure and run different queueing scenarios, allowing you to experiment with different process types and configurations.
